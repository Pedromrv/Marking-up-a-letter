# Marking up a letter

## Starting point

To test basic and advanced HTML text formatting and hyperlink skills, and knowledge of what goes in HTML.

### Project brief

For this project, I will mark up a letter that needs to be hosted on a university intranet. The letter is a response from a research fellow to a prospective PhD student concerning their application to work at the university.
